Title: YOLOv8 Object Detection App (Image Focus) with Confidence Threshold Control

Description:
This Streamlit application leverages the power of YOLOv8 for real-time object detection. It utilizes a pre-trained model, stored conveniently in helper.py, for efficient image processing. While the underlying code is capable of handling video and webcam streams, this specific implementation focuses on user-uploaded images.

Key Features:
Image Object Detection: Upload images and get real-time detections with YOLOv8.
Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained model resides in helper.py for streamlined deployment. 
Streamlit Integration: The intuitive Streamlit framework facilitates a user-friendly interface.
Configurable Confidence Threshold: Refine results by adjusting the confidence threshold (25-100%) to filter out low-certainty detections.
